## Objective ##
Aggregating Twitter, YouTube and breaking news with the historical knowledge of Wikipedia.

## Summary ##
Wikipedia is the sixth most-visited website in the United States [1], undoubtedly because of the instant answers
it can provide the casual web surfer. However, it's often incomplete.  In a world where financial markets
can turn on less than 140 characters, or the newest video superstar is born overnight,
a need exists for a resource that combines mankind's cumulative knowledge with the immediacy of the real world.
That's the main reason we're creating immedia.
